## Intake
 - Use this as a chance to round up data for teaching
 - data analytics class that focuses on:
   - regression
	 - time series
	 - simulation models
	   - Monte Carlo
		 - data mining
		   - cluster analysis
			 - association rules

## Challenges
 - don't do a great job of exposing students to real data
 - how feasible would it be to pull data from
   - Macro information
		 - BLS
		 - the Federal Reserve
			 - STL Fed [FRED]
		 - Bureau of Economic Analysis
	 - Micro data is a problem
	   - less interconnectivity than you might think
		 - have an idea of a relationship that you are exploring
		 - go out and colect a data set that supports the topic that you interested in
		 - usually restricted to use
		 - take the data, perform analysis, and publish
		 - example
		   - Jeff doesn't own the education records that he used for his research. Once the project is over, he is not able to use the information again. Concern is that federal regulations (FERPA)
 - handful of data sources
 - not interoperative

## The idea
 - Have a place to collect various public data sources about macro economic data
 - Allow for data visualization and exploratory analysis of said data
 - Allow for access (programmatic and graphical) to the data selected by the user
 - Facilitate data exploration for economics students
